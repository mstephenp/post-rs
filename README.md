# Sample Message Board Application
This server uses [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/) to create a REST API for managing posts in a message board-like application.

If used inside VS Code, the [rest client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) extension can be used with calls listed in dev.http. This makes it easy to work with the API functionality.
